# Shelfie

My library from The Odin Project Curriculum.

## About the project

Initially, Shelfie was only a simple app where a user could write and save information about books: title, author, etc, but 
this information was lost at the end of the session.

Further in the course came the proposal to make this initial app to persist the information using Firebase, from Google.

If you take a look at the preview, you'll find this last version, that allows users to log in and save books.
